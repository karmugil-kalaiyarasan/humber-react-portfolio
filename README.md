# React Portfolio site

Here is the active deployed link for my react portfolio site(https://humber-react-portfolio.netlify.app/#myPortfolio)

### Issues Faced:

I tried and hosted my laravel backend on the infinity free website after a long struggle. But unfortunately infinityfree only allow web hosting. But they dont allow API and Database sharing. So, I was not able to use the hosted laravel API though it is working fine. Here is the link to the official infinityfree forum link(https://forum.infinityfree.net/t/this-site-requires-javascript-to-work-please-enable-javascript-in-your-browser-or-use-a-browser-with-javascript-support/18309). Hence, I ended up using react json-server package and hosted it on heroku from which I am pulling the data through their api using Axios package manager. Here is the link to the json-server hosted on heroku(https://humber-react-portfolio-backend.herokuapp.com/).
